#Hotel Revenue Analysis (2018 - 2020)

I tried to explore the power of data analytics in unlocking insights into hotel revenue. This project is using Microsoft SQL Server to manage the dataset that can be accessed in 'SQLQuery_HotelRevenue.sql' and Power BI to create visualization and dashboard.

In this project, the dashboard that I build is going to solve several problem based on question below:
1. Is hotel revenue growing by year?
2. What market segment dominates based on hotel revenue?
3. What type of customer gives the highest revenue?
4. Should we increase hotel's parking lot size?

As we can see on the dashboard, in 2018 to 2019 hotels experienced quite rapid revenue growth in both types of hotels but in 2020 hotels experienced a significant decline in revenue.

On the other hand, the market segment is dominated by online travel agents with total revenue reaching 72.14% of the market segment. Also, Transient customer give the highest revenue to hotel. And last but not least, the parking car space. According to dashboard, there are 8.69 thousand car space and due to significant decline in revenue on 2020, so there are no needed to improve hotel parking lot size.

And there is my Data Analytics Project, I hope this help and give you more information about Data Analytics. If you found mistake in this post, feel free to comment down below or direct message me. Thank you.
